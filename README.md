# Http-Server

A HTTP server built from scratch in Python for fun and learning purposes!

## What is this?

Ever wondered how web servers actually work? Well, I did too! So I built this HTTP server from the ground up using nothing but Python, sockets, and a whole lot of curiosity. No frameworks, no fancy libraries - just pure code and the thrill of understanding how the web works under the hood.

## Why I Built This

I wanted to go beyond just using web frameworks and understand the fundamentals of how HTTP servers work. It's one thing to use Flask or Express, but building a server from scratch gives you a much deeper appreciation for the complexity and elegance of the HTTP protocol.

This project is purely for learning and fun - it's not meant to be production-ready, but hey, it works and teaches you the real deal behind web servers!

Built it just cause... why not?

## What I Learned

Building this server helped me understand:

- **HTTP Protocol**: How requests and responses are structured
- **Socket Programming**: Low-level network communication
- **Server Architecture**: Connection handling, request parsing, response generation
- **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes and error responses
- **Static File Serving**: How web servers serve files to browsers
